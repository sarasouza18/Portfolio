# **Sara Souza's Portfolio**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my professional journey, technical skills, and personal projects. The goal of this portfolio is to provide an overview of my work and expertise as a Software Engineer. 

You can view the live portfolio [here](https://sarasouza.github.io/).

## **Purpose of this Repository**

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website. It is meant to demonstrate how I structured and built the project, using clean and organized code with modern web development practices. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, or even contribute if you'd like!

## **How It Was Built**

The portfolio was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For adding interactivity and managing the dynamic parts of the site.
- **Vue.js**: The website is structured using Vue components to ensure scalability and maintainability. The components are modular, allowing for clean and efficient code management.
- **Nomenclature BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: This methodology was used to ensure the CSS code is maintainable and reusable.

## **How to View the Portfolio**

To check out the portfolio, you can simply visit the [live website](https://sarasouza.github.io/).

Alternatively, if you'd like to explore the code or run the project locally, follow the steps below.

## **Code Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/components**: Contains the Vue components, each section of the site (Intro, About, Contact) is modularized into separate components.
- **src/data**: Holds the data for sections like "About Me", "Skills", and "Projects" in separate files for better code separation and easier updates.
- **assets**: Contains images and other static files used in the website.
- **styles**: Holds the custom CSS styles applied to the site.

### **Why I Used Vue.js**

I chose Vue.js for this project because of its component-based architecture, which allows for better scalability and maintainability. Each part of the portfolio (Introduction, About Me, Contact, etc.) is separated into components, making it easier to manage and update. 

### **Best Practices Applied**

Throughout the development of this portfolio, I applied several best practices:

- **Component Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable and modular.
- **CSS BEM Methodology**: For better CSS maintainability and to avoid style conflicts.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data is stored in separate files and imported into components, making the site easier to update.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
